<h1>Valid Statements</h1>

<p>
  In Java, a statement is valid if it has the proper scope, the proper syntax, and the proper parameters. Classes cannot be static 
  in java, but methods and subclasses can. A message is printed with the syntax "System.out.print(string)" or "System.out.println(string)." 
  I had a AP computer science instructor once that insisted the one could use "cout <<" to display messages in Java, but this is innaccurate.
