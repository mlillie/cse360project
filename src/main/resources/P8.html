<h1>Visibility Modifiers</h1>

<p>Visibility Modifiers in Java are <b>public</b>, <b>private</b> and <b>protected</b.> <br>
If no visibility modifier is specified, an object has the <b>package</b> visibility <br>
Meaning that it is essentially public, except that only files in the same package can <br>
see it.
